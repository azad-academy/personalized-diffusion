# Beyond Diffusion: What is Personalized Image Generation and How Can You Customize Image Synthesis?
## Personalized Image Generation by Fine-Tuning the Stable Diffusion Models

## Requirements

If you would like to run it on your own PC instead then make sure you have sufficient hardware resources. Setup a Conda environment with python 3.10.6 and pytorch > 1.16.

## Running The Notebook

* Open the Notebook in Google Colab or local jupyter server
* Make sure GPU is selected in the runtime (Runtime->Change Type->GPU)
* Install the requirements
* Run the code in the example sections 
* In case of GPU out of memory error, make sure that the model from one example is cleared before running another example. Alternatively, you can restart the runtime and run that particular example directly instead of running the whole notebook.
